# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Real-Time Collaboration App is a Notion-lite application that enables users to create and collaboratively edit shared notes in real-time. The application supports multiple user roles (owner, editor, viewer) and provides live editing capabilities through WebSocket connections. Users can see changes from other collaborators instantly, making it ideal for team documentation, meeting notes, and collaborative writing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage notes, so that I can organize my thoughts and collaborate with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new note THEN the system SHALL save the note with the user as the owner
2. WHEN a user accesses their notes list THEN the system SHALL display all notes they own or have access to
3. WHEN a user opens a note THEN the system SHALL load the note content and establish a WebSocket connection for real-time updates
4. WHEN a user deletes a note they own THEN the system SHALL remove the note and notify all connected collaborators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a note owner, I want to invite collaborators with specific roles, so that I can control who can view and edit my notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an owner invites a user as an editor THEN the system SHALL grant the user read and write permissions to the note
2. WHEN an owner invites a user as a viewer THEN the system SHALL grant the user read-only permissions to the note
3. WHEN an owner changes a collaborator's role THEN the system SHALL update their permissions immediately
4. WHEN an owner removes a collaborator THEN the system SHALL revoke their access and disconnect them from the note
5. IF a user is not the owner THEN the system SHALL NOT allow them to invite other collaborators
6. WHEN an owner types in the email field THEN the system SHALL search for matching users and display suggestions
7. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show user names and email addresses for easy identification
8. WHEN an owner selects a user from search results THEN the system SHALL populate the email field with the selected user's email

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an editor, I want to edit notes in real-time with other collaborators, so that we can work together seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an editor types in a note THEN the system SHALL broadcast the changes to all connected collaborators within 100ms
2. WHEN multiple editors make simultaneous changes THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using operational transformation
3. WHEN an editor's cursor moves THEN the system SHALL show the cursor position to other collaborators
4. WHEN an editor joins a note session THEN the system SHALL display their presence indicator to other collaborators
5. IF a user has viewer role THEN the system SHALL NOT allow them to make edits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a viewer, I want to see real-time updates to notes, so that I can stay informed about changes without being able to edit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content changes in a note THEN the system SHALL update the viewer's display in real-time
2. WHEN a viewer opens a note THEN the system SHALL display the current content and show other collaborators' cursors
3. WHEN a viewer attempts to edit THEN the system SHALL prevent the action and display a read-only message
4. WHEN a viewer's session is active THEN the system SHALL show their presence to other collaborators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see who else is currently viewing or editing a note, so that I can coordinate with my collaborators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user joins a note session THEN the system SHALL display their avatar and name to other active collaborators
2. WHEN a user leaves a note session THEN the system SHALL remove their presence indicator within 5 seconds
3. WHEN a user is typing THEN the system SHALL show a typing indicator with their name
4. WHEN multiple users are present THEN the system SHALL display all active collaborators in a sidebar or header

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle connection issues gracefully, so that I don't lose my work when network problems occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
2. WHEN reconnecting THEN the system SHALL sync any local changes made during the disconnection
3. WHEN connection is unstable THEN the system SHALL queue changes locally and send them when connection is restored
4. WHEN a user makes changes offline THEN the system SHALL save changes locally and sync when connection returns
5. IF sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL present options to resolve the conflicts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and intuitive interface, so that I can focus on content creation without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface built with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI
2. WHEN a user navigates between notes THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and loading states
3. WHEN a user performs actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
4. WHEN multiple collaborators are present THEN the system SHALL use distinct colors to identify different users
5. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL be accessible and keyboard navigable
